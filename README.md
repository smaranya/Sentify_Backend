# Sentify_Backend
This project aims to make use of the Gradient Boosting Classifier and the VGG16 Model for text sentiment analysis and image captioning respectively.
- All the packages can be installed by using:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
- The file to train the model is Image_Analysis.ipynb (a Jupyter Notebook file)
- Text_Analysis.py shows you how the entire Text Analysis was actually done
- Backend.py file is the actual Backend code that must be run
- Make sure that you have a "working" folder containing a HDF5 file for the model, features_30k.pkl, mapping_30k.pkl and a tokenizer_30k.pkl that forms while the model is being trained

The dataset that you must download for the image captioning model is Flickr30_k dataset and the link is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset).
